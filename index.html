    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Welcome to Critterverse!</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Critterverse is a world beyond the galaxy where earth lies. Humans were wiped out after a mass extinction and never were able to
    bounce back-but other animals and mammals did. Critterverse may seem tame on the surface but faces hardships with climate and swinging
    enviromental changes that cause major natural disasters suddenly.</p>
